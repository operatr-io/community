# [OPERATR](https://operatr.io) for Apache Kafka®

Observe, explore, and control your streaming compute with one simple tool.

Works with Kafka 1.0+. On premise, in the cloud, self-managed, or hosted. See the installation guide for more.

Secure, self-contained, more than monitoring. Inspect topics, manage configuration, manage ACLs, integrate with Enterprise Monitoring, and deploy behind firewalls. Clip OPERATR on to a Kafka cluster for immediate value results.
